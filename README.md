# CS4410-Hajos-Cycle-Conjecture
The above project is a proof of a special case of Hajos Cycle Conjecture. 
Hajos cycle conjecture talks about decomposing Eulerian Graphs to a fixed number (bounded by function of the number of vertices in
the graph) of disjoint cycles.

The conjecture is still unresolved but this project discusses a new proof for graphs with maximum degree 4 and tree width bounded by 2.
